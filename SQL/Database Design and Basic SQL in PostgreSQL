Why Postgres?

for MySQL folks. Maybe Mariah will be the answer.
 But Oracle, I mean Postgres, has become kind of like this interesting alternative because it's ruggedly,
 solidly open source. And you may or may not have heard that Amazon, when it first started in the late nineties,
  chose Oracle.
  Why? Because it's what you did if you wanted a fast database and you didn't want to become a database company,
  which is not what Amazon wanted to become. And so they built a lot of stuff around the Oracle database.
  Well, the problem is that that cost them a lot of money and as Amazon got bigger and bigger and bigger their Oracle
   bill got bigger and bigger and bigger. And that made Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, very, very rich.
